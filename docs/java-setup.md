## ‚òï How to Install Java (Adoptium)

We recommend downloading **Eclipse Temurin** (an open-source Java distribution) from:

üîó https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17&package=jdk

1. Go to the link above and select the following options:
   - **Operating System**: Choose based on your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - **Architecture**: Select according to your system (e.g., `x64` for most Windows PCs, `aarch64` for Apple Silicon Macs)
   - **Package Type**: JDK
   - **Version**: Choose the version listed in the [üìã Which Java Version Should I Install to Play the Pack?](#which-java-version-should-i-install-to-play-the-pack) section. Always pick an <span className="bold-primary">LTS version</span> if available (e.g. 17-LTS).


Once installed, you can verify that Java is correctly set up by checking your version:

    ```
    ‚ö†Ô∏è If you get:
    ```
    "java" is not recognized as an internal or external command
    ```
    That means Java isn't installed, or it's not added to your system PATH.
